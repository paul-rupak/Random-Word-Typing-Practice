# Random-Word-Typing-Practice
This application is useful for beginners to practice touch typing. Users can choose some set of characters before start typing, typing-text will contain only those characters.

Learning touch typing is a step-by-step process. At every step, you will learn few characters and finger positions for them. You need to practice typing with those characters to create muscle memory, before going to next the step. At that time this application will be useful. You will be able to select which characters you want to practice, this application will give you a text that will contain only your selected characters.

This application will generate a random sequence of characters. Practiceing with random meaningless words is better than practicing with normal English words. It will increase your typing speed more. But typing random miningless words is more difficult than the normal English words.
